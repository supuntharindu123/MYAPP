This is a simple social media platform application using nodejs,expressjs, MongoDB and Bootsrap 5.
This application includes a login and registration page(with live validations), creating posts, deleting posts, editing posts, following users, a chat application, adding likes for posts, search posts etc.
I used a single-page application to improve user experience and included fully responsive pages.
Used libraries-Socket.IO, express, express-session, connect-mongo, connect-flash, sanitize-html, multer, axios, dotenv, mongodb, webpack(to bundle JavaScript libraries), dompurify, md5, bcryptjs and validator
